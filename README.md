Take the survey and see which other user is your closest musical match!

The app is currently mostly functional. Submitting the survey pushes a the new object into the friends array in (on the server, not persistent), and I'm pretty sure the logic in apiRoutes.js is working to find the closest match. However, I'm having trouble pulling the result from the 'best match' logic into the DOM and displaying it in the modal.

I'll keep working on this.
